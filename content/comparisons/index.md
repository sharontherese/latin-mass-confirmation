# About 

The Rite of Confirmation was changed dramatically after 1969. 

The Latin text currently in effect (from the third typical edition of the Roman Missal) is extremely difficult to find, and I am unable to include it in any comparisons.

In the meantime, we can compare the old and new English texts for the Rite of Confirmation. 

* For the **English text** of the **traditional** Rite of Confirmation, I have used Father Philip T. Weller's _Roman Ritual_, volume III. 
* For the **English text** of the **current** Rite of Confirmation, I have used the USCCB's _Order of Confirmation_, published in 2015, and required in 2016.  

I haven't changed any part of the text, but I have taken several liberties with formatting in order to make a visual comparison. 

Interestingly, both rites are about the same length (about 900 words), but there is nothing that is exactly the same in the old rite versus the new. I have  highlighted in yellow the relatively rare instances of of partial similarity in the rites.
