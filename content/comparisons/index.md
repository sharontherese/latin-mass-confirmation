# About 

The Rite of Confirmation was changed dramatically after 1969. 

The Latin text currently in effect (from the third typical edition of the Roman Missal) is extremely difficult to find. In the meantime, we can compare the old and new English texts for the Rite of Confirmation. 

For the English text of the traditional Rite of Confirmation, I have used Father Philip T. Weller's _Roman Ritual_, volume III. 

For the English text of the current Rite of Confirmation, I have used the USCCB's _Order of Confirmation_, published in 2015, and required in 2016.
